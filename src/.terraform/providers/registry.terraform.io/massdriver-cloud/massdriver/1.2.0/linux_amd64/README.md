# Terraform Provider Massdriver

This provider allows us to manage massdriver artifacts and package alarms generated from bundles right alongside the other resources in the bundle. It gives us delineated lifecycle events (create, update, destroy).

## Development Environment

This project comes with all of the tools you need dockerized in a dev container. Make sure your vscode installation has the plugin [remote-containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
Use the command palette to run `Remote-Containers: Open Folder In Container` this will install all the dependencies for development and testing as well as start LocalStack.

## Testing

### Setting up localstack resources

To create an SQS queue, an SNS topic and a topic subscription from SNS to SQS, which mirrors our infrastructure in production, run the follwing command

```shell
make local.setup
```

### Build the provider and install the terraform plugin

In order to run local versions of the provider we have to manually install it in our terraform plugins directory. To do this run

```shell
make install
```

### Test sample configuration

There are two ways to test the terraform provider end to end. The first is to run acceptance tests using the framework
that provided by Hashicorp. To run the tests it is helpful to open a split pane in your terminal. In one pane run the following command which will poll the sqs created in `local.setup` and display any messages received.

```shell
make local.sqs.poll
```

In the other pane run

```shell
make testacc
```

The second variation uses actual Terraform configuration to test the provider. In `examples/main.tf` you will find a Terraform resource file where you can stub inputs and use your resource as it would be in someone elses configuration. Using the split pane method above, use the `local.sqs.poll` command in one pane. In the other run

```shell
make local.apply
```
